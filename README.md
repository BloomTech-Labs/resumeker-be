can access queries and mutations for our server.

Optionally you can test these endpoints on Postman or Insomnia using the
GraphQL selection. Every query and mutation are treated as POST requests.

  subscription_id: STRING
}
```

## 2️⃣ Actions

🚫 This is an example, replace this with the actions that pertain to your backend

`getOrgs()` -> Returns all organizations

`getOrg(orgId)` -> Returns a single organization by ID

`addOrg(org)` -> Returns the created org

`updateOrg(orgId)` -> Update an organization by ID

`deleteOrg(orgId)` -> Delete an organization by ID
<br>
<br>
<br>
`getUsers(orgId)` -> if no param all users

`getUser(userId)` -> Returns a single user by user ID

`addUser(user object)` --> Creates a new user and returns that user. Also creates 7 availabilities defaulted to hours of operation for their organization.

`updateUser(userId, changes object)` -> Updates a single user by ID.

`deleteUser(userId)` -> deletes everything dependent on the user

## Environment Variables

In order for the app to function correctly, the user must set up their own environment variables.

create a .env file that includes the following:

_ STAGING_DB_URL - optional development db for using functionality not available in SQLite
_ NODE\*ENV - set to "development" until ready for "production"

-   JWKS\*URI - Auth0 Jwks client connection
-   AUTH0\*USERINFO - Auth0 domain with /userinfo endpoint to retreive user
-   AUTH0\*AUDIENCE
-   AUTH0_DOMAIN
